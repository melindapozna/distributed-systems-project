## About
This repository is the final project for the course ***Distributed Systems***.

## Setup
1. Install the libraries from *requirements.txt* in each directory (vendor_server, main_server, client).
2. Run main_server/main_server.py
3. *(Optional)* In case of a first run, you can choose to create and populate the vendor databases automatically by running vendor_server/setup.py. This creates entries for vendor1 and vendor2.
4. Run vendor_server/server.py and optionally vendor_server/server2.py.
5. Run client/menu.py. The client-server communication is threaded, you may run as many client instances at once as you wish.
